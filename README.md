# fox-valley-recreation-community
There's a lot of cool bike trails around the Fox Valley area in Wisconsin (Appleton, Neenah-Menasha, Oshkosh), I think it would nice to have a website with a map showing all of them, along with showing all the local parks and their amenities, as a resource that members of our community could use to discover things to do year-round in the Fox Valley area!
